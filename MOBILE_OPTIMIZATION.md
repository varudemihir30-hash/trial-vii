## 📝 Next Steps

### To Apply SCSS Changes (Optional)
If you want to compile the enhanced mobile menu SCSS changes:

1. Install Sass (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass
   ```

2. Compile SCSS to CSS:
   ```bash
   cd Aivora/assets/scss
   sass main.scss ../css/main.css
   ```

**Note**: The `mobile-optimization.css` file works independently and doesn't require compilation. The SCSS changes are enhancements to the existing mobile menu component.
